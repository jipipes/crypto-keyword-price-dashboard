# ðŸ“ˆ Crypto Keyword Price Dashboard

> "If words influence prices, where would we see the trace?"

This project visualizes the correlation between the frequency of crypto-related keywords and the price fluctuation of assets like Bitcoin, collected from various sources.

## Description

This project collects and analyzes what people are saying about specific cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin from various sources. It visualizes the relationship between the number of keyword mentions and actual price movements through an interactive dashboard.

## Objective

Bitcoin prices are difficult to explain with traditional indicators such as earnings or interest rates. This project is based on the hypothesis that public sentimentâ€”expressed through keywords in news, tweets, or online communitiesâ€”might influence the market.

It aims to build a system that visualizes the timeline of frequently mentioned keywords alongside price trends, making issue-reaction patterns intuitive.

## Key Features

- Automatic collection of crypto price data
- Extraction of top 10 frequently mentioned keywords from various sources
- Visualization of keyword-price relationships on a timeline
- Timeline highlights of keyword emergence and corresponding price movements
- Planned implementation using Streamlit dashboard
